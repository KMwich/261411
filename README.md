# 261411 Parallel Processing and Distributed Systems

## Course Overview

This course introduces the theoretical and practical views of parallel programming and distributed system. On one hand, parallel processing explores the idea that there will be multiple processing units inside a computer, thus, multiple task can be executed concurrently. This will extend the model of Von Neumann architecture and need new model for algorithm analysis and design. On the other hand, distributed systems focus on interaction among multiple computers with a common goal. This course will provides both theoretical idea and practical details for both subjects.

## Course Learning Objectives
1. Apply the concepts of parallel processing
2. Apply the concepts of distributed system

# Grading Rubrics
## Professional Conduct
We expect our students to conduct themselves professionally, at least, for the following areas:
- Taking personal responsibility for class prerequisites and coming to class prepared
- Taking personal responsibility for scheduling and managing the homework
- Treating others in a respectful manner
- Plagiarism is not acceptable in any cases
- Accepting things you cannot change, working respectfully within the system to change things you can, and choosing your battles wisely

## Attendance including Active & Enthusiastic Participation
- Prepares for class by watching and studying the textbooks and readings.
- Answers in-class questions frequently
- Actively participates and frequently takes a leadership role in break outs

## Making Up Missed Classes
- Whether excused or unexcused absence, missed classes must be made up in order to earn a grade of B or higher for the semester
- To make up a class, students study the slide, work any in-class exercises on their own, write up an executive summary, and submit the executive summary to the instructor using a Microsoft team on email before the next class meeting start time
- Executive Summary should be a PDF file, 1 to 1.5 pages in length, professionally formatted,12 point Calibri font, 1 inch margins, 1.08 line spacing

## Assignments
- 8 Assignments, count as 20% toward final score
- 7 of 8 will count
  - 1 lowest will be dropped
  - However, to be dropped, the assignment must be turned in with a reasonable attempt
- Each assignment is graded in whole numbers between 0 and 10 points
  - Subjective = 2 of 10 points
    - Most students will score a 1 on subjective on most assignments
    - A score of 2 on subjective indicates exceptional performance and typically only 10% of students in a section will make this
  - Objective = 8 of 10 points
- Late Submissions
  - Assignments 1 through 7
    - When grading, a zero will be put in as a "placeholder"  for missing submissions and changed when they are submitted
    - 1 of 10 points penalty for 1 second late
    - Additional 1 point penalty for each additional 24 hours late
    - After 10 days late, the assignment will be worth zero points
  - Assignment 8
    - Due to end of semester time constraints, late submissions for assignment 8 will have the following late penalties
    - 5 of 10 points for 1 second lateZero for the assignment if 24 hours late
    
## Exams
- Midterm exam
  - Cover the content of week 1 - 7
  - Count 40% toward final score
  - Open book
- Final exam
  - Cover the content of week 8 - 14
  - Count 40% toward final score
  - Open book
